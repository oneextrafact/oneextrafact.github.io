Hi there! Thanks for visiting my blog, which is a work in progress as I learn more about Jekyll and static site generation. Currently trying to figure out how jekyll-archives works so I can have some structure to my navigation menu (404s for now). I'm planning to write mostly about PyData and Long Island, and occasionally to report my progress as I try to learn woodworking.

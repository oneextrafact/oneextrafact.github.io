![Some rough wood](/assets/images/IMG_0889.jpeg)

My first piece of rough wood! A hickory scrap from the nice folks at Urban Specialty Woods. I'm planning to use it to make a new handle for a hatchet that I bought at the Bellmore Flea Market, my favorite haunt for old tools. It's substantially heavier than I might have thought, I'm looking forward to learning a lot from it.

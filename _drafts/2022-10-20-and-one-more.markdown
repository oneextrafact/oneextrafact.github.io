I've been paying a lot more attention to LinkedIn lately as I'm building what I hope is a strong base for PyData Long Island. I noticed something funny on my mom's profile - there was a count of 7 mutual connections, but when I went in to look at them there were only 6 profiles. Something similar on other profiles I share, there would be a reference to "and one more...", but that profile was missing. I'm pretty sure what's missing is my brother Kevin's profile. Kevin died of neuroendocrine cancer two years ago, at the age of 46. For a long time his profile was still up, and I would go visit it every once in a while just to see him. I was somewhat sad when it finally came down. It looks like it's still there, though. It's too valuable for LinkedIn to really give it up, because he connected so many people together. He was a bridge in their network, I have no doubt of it.
